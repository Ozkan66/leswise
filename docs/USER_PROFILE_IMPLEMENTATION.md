# User Profile Management Implementation

This document describes the implementation of Epic 1.2: User Profile Management functionality.

## Overview

The user profile management system allows users to:
- Edit personal information (name, email)
- Select and change their role (teacher/student)
- Add role-specific information
- Upload and manage profile photos
- Maintain GDPR/AVG compliance

## Implementation Details

### Components Created

#### 1. UserProfile Component (`/web/src/components/UserProfile.tsx`)
- Main profile management interface
- Handles all user profile operations
- Includes role-specific form fields
- Photo upload with validation
- Real-time form validation and error handling

#### 2. Profile Page (`/web/src/app/profile/page.tsx`)
- Next.js app router page for profile management
- Simple wrapper around UserProfile component

### Features Implemented

#### Personal Data Management (US 1.2.1)
- ✅ Edit first name and last name
- ✅ Update email address
- ✅ Real-time validation and error feedback
- ✅ Immediate save and visual confirmation

#### Role Selection & Management (US 1.2.2)
- ✅ Role selection during first login (existing functionality)
- ✅ Role editing in profile page
- ✅ Redirect to profile after initial role selection
- ✅ Dynamic form fields based on selected role

#### Student-Specific Fields (US 1.2.3)
- ✅ Birth year input with validation (1990-current year)
- ✅ Education type selection (VMBO, HAVO, VWO, MBO, HBO, WO, Anders)
- ✅ Privacy-conscious data handling
- ✅ Fields only visible when student role is selected

#### Teacher-Specific Fields (US 1.2.4)
- ✅ Institution name input
- ✅ Subjects taught (comma-separated list)
- ✅ Fields only visible when teacher role is selected
- ✅ Internal-only data (not publicly displayed)

#### Profile Photo Management (US 1.2.5)
- ✅ Photo upload with file validation
- ✅ File size limit (5MB maximum)
- ✅ File type validation (JPG, PNG, GIF only)
- ✅ Image preview before saving
- ✅ Supabase storage integration
- ✅ Public URL generation and metadata storage

### Technical Implementation

#### Data Storage
- User metadata stored in Supabase Auth user_metadata
- Profile photos stored in Supabase Storage bucket 'profile-photos'
- Role-specific fields conditionally stored based on user role

#### User Flow
1. User logs in → Checks for role → Redirects to role-selection if needed
2. After role selection → Redirects to profile page for completion
3. Profile page allows editing all information
4. Navigation includes clickable profile link showing user name

#### Validation & Security
- Client-side validation for all form fields
- File upload restrictions (size, type)
- GDPR compliance messaging
- Privacy-focused design for student data
- Row-level security for profile photo storage

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for all operations
- Loading states during API calls
- Fallback displays for missing data
- Network error recovery

### Database Schema Updates

#### Supabase Storage Bucket
```sql
-- profile-photos bucket with RLS policies
-- Users can upload/update/delete their own photos
-- Public read access for profile photo viewing
```

See: `/supabase/migrations/20231221000000_create_profile_photos_bucket.sql`

### Testing
